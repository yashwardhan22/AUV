# Facial Expression Recognition Challenge
The jupyter notebook available here showcase my approach to tackle the kaggle problem of [Facial Expression Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge).
Collect dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data).
